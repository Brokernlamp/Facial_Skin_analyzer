Hello! this is a demonstration of YOLO ( You only look once) model in use for facial skin recognition. 
You can use this project and tune the Oiliness and skin type accordingly by changing the setting 30th and 36th lines of skin_analysis.py file. 
YOLO was trained over 4800 images and labels to generate a .pt model which is deployed in live feed model. 
Clone the repository and RUN <MAIN.PY> file.
Remember: If you have 2 cameras " cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)" on 29th line of <main.py> VideoCapture(0): uses default camera, changin it to VideoCapture(1): uses secondary camera.
Thank You!
